Business Overview
Understanding earthquake patterns is essential for various stakeholders, including seismologists, geologists, and disaster management agencies. By analyzing earthquake data, we can gain insights into the frequency, magnitude, and locations of seismic events. This information helps in studying tectonic activities, assessing risks, and implementing appropriate measures for earthquake preparedness.

Installation
To use the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.7 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python libraries (pandas, matplotlib, etc.)
You can install the required Python libraries by running the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To run the code and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/earthquake-data.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd earthquake-data

Data
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from a reliable earthquake database. It includes information about earthquake events such as location, date, time, magnitude, and depth. The dataset is provided in CSV format.

Analysis
The analysis involves exploring the earthquake data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. It includes various visualizations, statistical summaries, and time series analysis techniques to understand the distribution and characteristics of earthquakes.

Evaluation
The evaluation of the earthquake analysis can be based on several criteria, such as the accuracy of predicting earthquake occurrences, the effectiveness of identifying patterns or trends in seismic activity, and the practicality of the insights gained from the analysis. Additionally, the evaluation can include comparing the results of the analysis with existing scientific knowledge and previous research in the field.
